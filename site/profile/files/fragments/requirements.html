    <h4>Puppet Fundamentals (PF) / Puppet Practitioner (PP)</h4>
  
    <p>For Fundamentals and Practitioner we've set up a test environment you can use to validate that your system meets the classroom requirements. Simply click below and follow the directions to ensure that you'll be able to fully participate in our classes.</p>
  
    <input type="button" class="btn btn-primary get-started" value="Get Started" onclick="javascript:window.location = 'http://' + window.location.hostname + ':9090'" />

If the test fails to launch when you click the button, then please inform us of the issue by responding to the email you received or by directly emailing <a href="mailto:eduteam@puppet.com">eduteam@puppet.com</a>.</p>
